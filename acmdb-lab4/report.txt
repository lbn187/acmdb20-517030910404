IntHistogram
Given the number of buckets, minimum value and maximum value, I can calculate the size of each bucket, and estimate the value we want.
The size is (max-min)/bucket+1, the only thing to do is find where the value is and calculate it.

TableStats
Scan the table to build the statistics to help us implement the histograms.
